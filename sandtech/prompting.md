# Prompting - Part One

The magic of artificial intelligence (AI) truly reveals itself in the way these systems interact with us - and it all starts with a well-crafted prompt. But what is a well-crafted prompt, and why does it wield such a significant influence?

A prompt serves as an initial statement or question that we feed to an AI model. The model uses this prompt to create a fitting output or response. It's like giving the AI a direction to follow, a path to take.

Think of prompts like keys - they're designed to access particular information in the vast database of the AI's learned knowledge. When the fit is right, the door opens. That's why clarity and precision matter so much in prompting.

However, creating an effective prompt isn't merely about making it clear and specific. It also has to resonate with the required context and hit the mark. A good prompt always takes the user's needs into consideration, ensuring that it accurately steers the AI's response in a way that is both useful and pertinent.

## Power of Prompts

Prompts are critical in AI communication, serving as input to AI tools like ChatGPT to trigger responses. The specificity and quality of a prompt dramatically influence the correspondence generated by AI, leveraging natural language processing to interpret everyday language.

The art of prompt engineering helps manipulate the AI's behavior and output. Clear and detailed prompts can generate precise and efficient responses, significantly aiding in content creation or data extraction tasks.

One should learn to give specifics in their prompts, just like giving verbal instructions, to ensure optimal responses from AI. This form of communication with AI is integral in today's evolving AI workspace. The power of the prompt lies in generating accurate and contextually relevant responses, enhancing AI-assisted productivity.

## Writing Clear and Specific Prompts

Creating a balanced prompt for AI is much like drawing a clear and detailed map. The clarity and specificity of your prompts are essential in guiding your AI to the desired destination. Here's how to get there:

Start by keeping it simple. Use straightforward language and avoid complex sentences or jargon that might lead the AI astray. But remember, while simplicity is key, your prompts should still provide the AI with comprehensive information it needs to generate the correct response.

Next, be direct with your requests. If you need a particular outcome from the AI, state it clearly and early in your prompt. Don't forget about format and intent. Should the answer appear in a bullet list or formal tone? Make sure to weave these details into your prompt.

Finally, remember, it's okay if you don't get it right the first time. Use the AI’s response to refine your prompt, making necessary tweaks until you get the result you want. Clear and specific prompts can dramatically improve your interactions with AI models and, with practice, harnessing the full potential of AI becomes easier than ever.

### Basic components of a prompt

- **Instruction** : This is essentially the 'task' or 'action' that you're asking the AI model to perform. It directly informs the model what you need from it, whether it's summarizing a text, generating an idea, or answering a question.

Example: `Generate a list of 5 potential solutions to reduce carbon emissions.`

- **Context** : The background or setting that surrounds your prompt. Providing context makes your prompt more understandable to the AI model, influencing its understanding and the relevance of its responses.

Example Task: Write a science fiction story

- Without Context
  `Write a science fiction story.`

- With Context
  `Write a science fiction story set in a post-apocalyptic future where humans coexist with sentient machines.`

- **Example** : These are specific instances or situations you could provide to guide the AI model's understanding of the task at hand. Examples can be especially beneficial in demonstrating the level of detail or analytical depth you expect in the response.

Example Task: Design a workout routine

- Without Example:
  `Design a full body workout routine.`

- With Example:
  `Design a full body workout routine similar to HIIT (High Intensity Interval Training) but with low impact exercises for joint safety.`

- **Role** : The part you want the AI model to play in the conversation. Do you want it to play the expert consultant, an enthusiastic brainstorming partner, or a neutral presenter of data? Defining the role can shape the tone and style of its responses.

Example Task: Provide travel advice

- Without Role:
  `Give travel advice for someone visiting Japan.`

- With Role:
  `As a long-time resident of Japan who writes travel guides, give travel advice for someone visiting Japan for the first time.`

- **Tone** : This influences how the AI model communicates its response. The tone could be professional, casual, cheerful, or serious, to match the intended sentiment of the interaction.

Example Task: Explain a complex subject

- Without Tone
  `Explain the theory of relativity.`
- With Tone:
  `Explain the theory of relativity in a light-hearted and easy-to-understand manner.`

Example Task: Convey an important message

- Without Tone:
  `Write a reminder about an upcoming deadline.`
- With Tone:
  `Write a friendly yet urgent reminder about an upcoming deadline.`

- **Intended Audience** : Knowing who the output is intended for can help in crafting the prompt itself. An AI model might craft different responses if the intended audience is children, industry experts, or novices in the subject.

Example Task: Explain a complex subject

- Without Audience
  `Explain the concept of blockchain technology.`
- With Audience
  `Explain the concept of blockchain technology to someone with no technical background.`

- **Output Format** : This is a guide for how you want the AI model to structure its response. It could be in the form of a bulleted list, a paragraph of prose, a table, or any other specific layout.

Example Task: Write a short story

- Without Output Format
  `Write a short story about overcoming adversity.`
- With Output Format
  `Write a short story about overcoming adversity, formatted with an introduction, three body sections each developing a different aspect of the story, and a conclusion that brings it all together.`

Example Task: List key points

- Without Output Format
  `Tell me the key characteristics of a good leader.`
- With Output Format
  `Tell me the key characteristics of a good leader, in the form of a bulleted list.`

### Puting the components together

Effective prompt crafting is akin to piecing together a thoughtful puzzle. This involves carefully arranging each essential component into a coherent whole, ensuring that the AI can seamlessly process and act on each piece. This approach mirrors the assembly of well-structured prompt components in a way that guarantees clear communication and comprehension by the AI model. By understanding how to connect these essential elements, you can heighten the relevance and accuracy of the AI's generated output.

For example:

`As a professional health consultant, [Role Descriptor & Tone] provide advice [Instruction] for someone trying to balance a busy work life with maintaining a healthy diet and exercise regime [Context]. Similar to a blog article titled '10 Steps for Work-Health Balance' [Example], and structure your advice as 5 actionable bullet points [Specifics about Output Format] suitable for a general audience with no prior health knowledge [Intended Audience].`

## Zero shot vs Few shot prompting

Prompting styles in AI can have different approaches, from Zero Shot to Few Shot prompting. To understand these approaches, we first need to understand what "shot" stands for. In AI, a "shot" is referred to as an example.

### Zero Shot Prompting:

Zero shot prompting implies that no examples are being provided to guide our AI model's response. Instead, the AI is presented with a task using only the prompt's instructional, contextual, and other components, without any reference to specific instances where a similar task has been performed. Essentially, a zero-shot prompt encourages the model to accomplish a task it has not directly learned before using its pre-existing knowledge.

Examples:

- `As a health consultant, suggest a balanced diet plan for someone who is vegan and also gluten intolerant. Please list the meal plan for a week, with designated breakfast, lunch, and dinner items.`
- `Assuming the role of a film critic, write a review of the film 'Inception' directed by Christopher Nolan in a formal tone and make sure it's easy to understand for someone with little knowledge of film theory.`

### Few Shot Prompting:

In few shot prompting, we provide several examples of the type of task the AI model is being asked to perform. These examples serve as a 'primer' to the AI, helping it recognize what is being asked and formulate an appropriate response. Few-shot prompts are especially useful when our task is complex or if we're targeting a specific style, tone, or format.

Examples:

```
As a creative writer, please make these everyday expressions more poetic

Everyday: "The sun is setting",
Poetic: "The grand orb of daylight descends to slumber."

Now, make 'The grass is growing' more poetic
```

```
Write in an upbeat tone a support email to a customer.

Message: 'We are sorry you are experiencing issues'
Upbeat Tone: 'Oh no! We're really sorry to hear that you're having some trouble.'

Message: 'Your refund will be processed in 3-5 business days'
Upbeat Tone: ?

```

## Chain of Thought Prompting

Chain of thought prompting is a powerful approach to guide language models (LLMs) through complex reasoning, decision-making, and problem-solving tasks. This technique involves breaking down a problem into smaller, digestible steps or instructions - effectively forming a logic chain for the AI model to follow.

Chain-of-thought prompting can significantly improve an AI’s performance on tasks that require complex reasoning or problem solving. By breaking tasks into smaller chunks — whether thinking aloud or following a set sequence of instructions — the model can generate outputs that more accurately and logically tackle the task at hand.

### Guiding the model through a thought process

In this approach, you ask the model to think aloud, effectively documenting its step-by-step reasoning process. Requesting the model to explain each step of processing aids in transparency and could lead to a better understanding of how the AI is arriving at its conclusion.

For example, if the task involves mathematical problem-solving, we might say:

`Considering the equation 2x + 7 = 15, solve for x step-by-step, and explain your reasoning at each step.`

The model then would be prompted to articulate its thought process as it works incrementally to isolate the variable 'x' and solve the equation.

Another example:
`As a botanist, guide us through the process by which sunlight and carbon dioxide contribute to a plant's growth. Break down the photosynthesis process in detail, step by step.`

### Providing an instruction sequence for the model

This method works on the basis of ordered instructional prompts. The user provides a sequence of steps that the model must follow, effectively outlining a framework of logic or process that the AI should adhere to.

Example 1:

```
You are a skilled chef creating a new dessert recipe. Write a creative, unique recipe mixing traditional elements with an innovative twist.

1. Start by naming the dessert and giving a brief description of what it is
2. List the ingredients required, marking any non-traditional or special items.
3. Describe the preparation process step-by-step.
4. Explain how to serve and present the dessert for visual appeal.
5. Add an inviting closing remark suggesting who might enjoy this dessert.
```

Example 2:

```
You're a well-known travel blogger creating a guide for a three-day visit to Rome. Provide an itinerary that balances famous spots with hidden gems.

1. Give an enticing overview of Rome as a travel destination.
2. Layout the activities for Day 1 focused on famous attractions.
3. or Day 2, suggest a mix of lesser-known sites and relaxing leisure activities.
4. Plan Day 3 around a combination of sightseeing, dining, and appreciating local culture.
5. Conclude with suggestions on places to buy unique souvenirs and a reminder of the magic Rome offers.
```

### Requesting the model to assess its own response

Just as important as generating a response, is the ability for an AI model to self-assess and critique its own outputs. This provides an opportunity for it to catch any inaccuracies, inconsistencies or areas of potential improvement – effectively building self-correction into the AI model’s workflow.

This can be implemented through prompts that directly ask the model to evaluate the quality of its prior responses. Here's how it might look in practice:

- After generating a response, you could request: "Now, review and rate the quality of your previous response." The AI could then provide insights on how well it answered the prompt and where improvement may be needed.

- For responses involving suggesting an idea or crafting a solution, you might ask: "Reflect on the proposal/solution you just provided. What are the potential flaws or weaknesses that could be addressed?" The model would then scrutinize its own suggestions in light of this.

## Iterative approach

When working with large language models like ChatGPT, it's essential to recognize that prompting is an iterative process. The iterative approach involves a cyclical process of trial, analysis, refinement, and repetition to elicit the desired response from the model.

This approach acknowledges that the initial prompt may not always yield the expected outcome, and that the model may require guidance, clarification, and time to produce high-quality results.

The iterative approach can be broken down into the following stages:

1. **Initial Prompting**: Craft an initial prompt that outlines the task, question, or topic you want the model to address.
2. **Model Response**: The model generates a response based on the initial prompt.
3. **Analysis and Evaluation**: Analyze the model's response to identify areas where it falls short of your expectations. This may involve evaluating the response's accuracy, relevance, coherence, or tone.
4. **Refinement and Clarification**: Based on the analysis, refine the prompt by clarifying ambiguities, providing additional context, or rephrasing the question to better align with your goals.
5. **Repeat and Refine**: Repeat the process, using the refined prompt to elicit a new response from the model.
